## Exercises 
1\. Load the `tissue_gene_expression` dataset. Remove the row means and compute the distance between each observation. Store the result in `d`. 
2\. Make a hierarchical clustering plot and add the tissue types as labels. 
3\. Run a k-means clustering on the data with $K=7$. Make a table comparing the identified clusters to the actual tissue types. Run the algorithm several times to see how the answer changes. 
4\. Select the 50 most variable genes. Make sure the observations show up in the columns, that the predictors are centered, and add a color bar to show the different tissue types. Hint: use the `ColSideColors` argument to assign colors. Also, use `col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "RdBu")` for a better use of colors.
